## udbcd-project5 Decentralized Star Notary Service   ##
#### Udacity Blockchain Developer Nanodegree Program  ####
This project is connected to the _Blockchain Developer Nanodegree Program_ course by **Udacity**.
In this project, we  build a CryptoStar Dapp on Ethereum Platform .

This Project should Modify the StarNotary version 2 contract code to achieve the following:
```
*   Add a name and a symbol for your starNotary tokens. Resource
*   Add a function lookUptokenIdToStarInfo, that looks up the stars using the Token ID, and
then returns the name of the star.
*   Add a function called exchangeStars, so 2 users can exchange their star tokens...Do not worry about the price, just write code to exchange stars between users.
*   Write a function to Transfer a Star. The function should transfer a star from the address of the caller. The function should accept 2 arguments, the address to transfer the star to, and the token ID of the star.
```
